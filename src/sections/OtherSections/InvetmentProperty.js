              If you're looking at buying an investment property, most
              strategies fit into one of these three categories:

          <div className="space-y-4 lg:space-y-1vw">
            <p className="fs-24px text-wodden-purple">Build Capital</p>

            <p className="fs-16px text-wodden-purple">
              The property market is a great way to build capital for your
              future. Unlike other investments, many of which are highly
              speculative, real estate investing is a stable long-term strategy
              capable of building capital over time. The property market in
              Australia continues to experience unprecedented levels of growth,
              with value based on strong fundamentals linked with market demand.
              Capital growth is a passive long-term property investment
              strategy, allowing you to build equity slowly and roll gains over
              into additional properties.

          <div className="space-y-4 lg:space-y-1vw">
            <p className="fs-24px text-wodden-purple">Generate Income</p>

            <p className="fs-16px text-wodden-purple">
              Along with investing in your future, the property market can be a
              great way to generate ongoing rental income. This strategy is all
              about boosting cash flow, so there's less focus on capital growth
              or expensive renovations. Using this strategy, your property needs
              to earn more income through rent than it costs through mortgage
              payments, rates, and maintenance. A cash flow strategy can be used
              for commercial and residential property investment. Buying an
              income property can increase your borrowing capacity, but it
              provides fewer tax benefits than capital or renovation projects.

          <div className="space-y-4 lg:space-y-1vw">
            <p className="fs-24px text-wodden-purple">Boost Value</p>

            <p className="fs-16px text-wodden-purple">
              In addition to long-term capital growth and consistent rental
              income, some residential property investors boost the value of
              their property through renovations. From small projects to major
              expansions, this strategy can be a great way to increase the value
              of your investment. Renovation projects also help to increase
              rental gains, especially in competitive markets. If you buy the
              right property in a good location and make smart renovation
              decisions, you can flip your asset and move on to your next
              project with money in your pocket.
