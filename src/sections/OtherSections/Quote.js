        “The guys at Ten Squared were awesome from start to finish. Anyone
        working shift work in the mines knows how hard it is to get anything
        done outside of work. The guys took care of every single thing for me
        from the start to the very finish. I had always been looking for a way
        to legally reduce the amount of tax I was paying, as I wanted to put as
        much back into my property to help set myself and my family up. The
        property the guys hand-picked for us was great and the depreciation has
        been a great way of getting more money back every year.”
