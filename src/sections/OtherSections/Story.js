            Corin works in the Mudgee coal mine, has been very time poor due to
            the long work hours or extended shifts. Corin asked us how we could
            help him reduce the amount of tax he was paying whilst growing his
            property portfolio, we sat down and built a comprehensive plan for
            Corin that would allow him to build a property portfolio and reduce
            his taxable income.{" "}
          </p>

          <p className="fs-16px text-wodden-purple">
            Corin was able to do this without using a cent from his own pocket,
            how we did was helping Corin re-finance his current property so he
            could access his equity to fund the purchase of a dual-key
            investment property in the Hunter Region, NSW. The benefit of using
            equity in an existing property for Corin was that he could access
            the required deposit without using any of his savings and also get
            further tax deductions on the interest repayments, lowering his
            taxable income again.
