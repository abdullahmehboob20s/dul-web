            Property management is important to consider when you own one or
            more investment properties. It’s a broad range of duties and
            responsibilities, including sourcing tenants, carrying out property
            inspections, general maintenance, organising repairs, collecting
            rent and more. In fact, Australian property management is a
            full-time job in and of itself, especially if you own more than a
            handful of properties.
          </p>

          <p className="fs-16px text-wodden-purple">
            Property management presents a challenge for many investors.
            First-time property investors often want to oversee the process
            themselves, particularly if they’ve got some handyman skills and can
            conduct repairs. However, this rapidly becomes impractical once
            there’s more than one property involved. This also becomes
            increasingly complex if the property portfolio is spread over a
            broad geographic area.
          </p>

          <p className="fs-16px text-wodden-purple">
            Whether it’s commercial or residential property management, it can
            be incredibly time-consuming to stay on top of everything. The point
            of property investment is to generate passive income. Being directly
            involved in the day-to-day oversight often runs contrary to what
            investors were seeking in the first place!
          </p>

          <p className="fs-16px text-wodden-purple">
            For many investors, the default option is turning to real estate
            agents. Real estate agents often offer real property management as
            part of their services. However, the downside is that you can’t
            necessarily determine where your properties sit within their
            priorities. Are day-to-day affairs being overseen as effectively as
            possible? Or are they being pushed down the list in favour of other
            duties? The quality of your rental property management directly
            impacts your ability to retain or source new tenants — and,
            accordingly, your income.
          </p>

          <p className="fs-16px text-wodden-purple">
            This is where a property management company can assist. Property
            management companies are specialists in overseeing rental properties
            proactively. By having a dedicated team assigned to your properties,
            you can rest assured that your needs — and those of your tenants —
            are being met precisely how and when they need to be.
