            Investing in property can be highly lucrative, but it's often
            complicated and overwhelming. Whether you're just starting out or
            looking to expand your portfolio, successful investing requires a
            solid investment strategy. From capital growth and depreciation to
            negative gearing and rental income, a range of approaches can be
            used to build equity and generate cash flow.
